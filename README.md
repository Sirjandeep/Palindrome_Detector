                                                    "The Palindrome Challenge"
In the enchanting village of Palindromia, there lived a wise elder named Elara. Elara was known throughout the village for her knowledge of words and her ability to detect palindromes.
A palindrome, as she explained to curious villagers, was a word or phrase that remained the same when read forward and backward.
One sunny day, a group of young villagers approached Elder Elara with a challenge.
They had heard about her legendary skills and asked if she could teach them how to determine if a word or phrase was a palindrome.
Elara agreed to help and decided to make it a friendly competition. She gathered the villagers and said, "To become skilled in the ways of detecting palindromes, you must pass a test.
I will provide you with a word, and you must write a Python program to check if it's a palindrome without using any additional data structures. You may only use your code and your wits."
The word Elara chose was "RADAR," .
